# Middle School & High School Projects
A collection of small projects I made in middle school and high school.

## HTML

### mario-history.html
A basic webpage detailing the history of 3D Mario games.

### scratch.html
This is a webpage I made to help younger students learn how to use scratch.

## Programs
All of these programs were made using [CodeSkulptor](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/), so running these programs there is more likely to work. Along with this, some of these programs are unfinished.

### AdditionSolver.py
An unfinished program that would simplify addition operations such as `10 + 20x + 12 + x`

### DecimalToFraction.py


### DivisonSolver.py


### EquationSolver.py


### isRational.py


### MultiplicationV1.py, MultiplicationCurrentVersion.py, NextMultiplicationSolver.py


### MusicTheory.py


### QuadraticFormula.py


### RockPaperScissors.py
Program to play Rock Paper Scissors versus an AI. Uses CodeSkulptor's SimpleGUI module, so can only be run [here](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user49_HgcAbl7wiW_0.py) for now.

### TextEncrypter.py


### TicTacToe.py
Program to play Tic-Tac-Toe versus another person or an AI. Uses CodeSkulptor's SimpleGUI module, so can only be run [here](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user49_hpE3SRSyb8_0.py) for now.
